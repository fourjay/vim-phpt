# PHPT filetype plugin

Adds a phpt filetype, with additional syntax to highlight PHPT keywords

Default handling of PHPT is to treat it as a form of php, which certainly
works.
But it's not really a php file but a test file, and deserves it's own filetype.
This allows the syntax, but also hanging behavior off of the filetype such as

* custom snippets
* special debug functions
* compiler
